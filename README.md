# Graphics Project: Helicopter 2D Animation (Pygame)


![Screen Recording 2026-01-02 210621 (online-video-cutter com)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efdd8d8a-145f-4b41-818a-b870959a2bd8)

This mini-project implements a simple state-based 2D animation in Python using Pygame. It draws a helicopter with basic shapes, simulates rotor rotation, vertical takeoff, horizontal flight (via background scrolling), landing, and rotor spin-down.

## Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the animation:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Windows quick run

- Double-click [run.bat](run.bat), or from PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  .\run.bat
  ```
  This uses the project venv at .venv automatically, falling back to `python` in PATH.

Tested on Windows with Python 3.9+.
