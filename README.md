# Graphics Project: Helicopter 2D Animation (Pygame)

This mini-project implements a simple state-based 2D animation in Python using Pygame. It draws a helicopter with basic shapes, simulates rotor rotation, vertical takeoff, horizontal flight (via background scrolling), landing, and rotor spin-down.

## Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the animation:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

Tested on Windows with Python 3.9+.
